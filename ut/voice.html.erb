        <h5>Our Voice</h5>
        <p>The Untappd voice is human. It‚Äôs personal and interested. Overall, we are very colloquial, conversational. We want to give the user the impression that we would be a fun person to meet out at the bar and for a beer. In that sense, we are youthful, but not immature. When speaking about events, we are current, but not controversial. Free of presumption and pretension; we are enthusiastic about beer and the community surrounding it. Our voice is playfully chiding, but never insulting or condescending. It is always positive, knowledgeable, and empowers our users.</p>

        <h5> Our Tone</h5>
        <p>Recognize the state of mind of the users and respond accordingly. Personal, supportive, informative and jovial.</p>

        <h6>George Orwell's Six Elementary Rules</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Never use a <a hfef="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/metaphors">Metaphor</a>, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
          <li>Never use a long word where a short one will do (see Short words).</li>
          <li>If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out (see Unnecessary words).</li>
          <li>Never use the <a href="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/passive">Passive</a> where you can use the active.</li>
          <li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a <a href="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/jargon">Jargon</a> word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
          <li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous (see <a href="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.</h6>
        <p>In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.</p>

        <ul class="no-bullet quote">
          <li>üëç <q>Kurt logged into the account.</q></li>
          <li>üëé <q>The account was logged into by Kurt.</q></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Words like ‚Äúwas‚Äù and ‚Äúby‚Äù may indicate that you‚Äôre writing in passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.</p>

        <p>One exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.</p>
        <ul class="no-bullet quote">
